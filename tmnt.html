                <q>Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped to excuse the concept's inherent corniness, the movie attempts to look polished and 'cool,' but the been-there animation can't compete with the then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie.</q>

                <q>I will never watch this movie again. I can't believe I took all of my dwarves and creature friends with me. Perhaps I should have taken them to a G movie</q>

                <q>The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof.</q>

                <q>The striking use of image and motion allows each sequence to leave an impression. It's an accomplished restart to this franchise.</q>

                <q>The script feels like it was computer generated. This mechanical presentation lacks the cheesy charm of the three live action films.</q>
