0. For my final project I want to do something with APIs. What I was thinking was having a site where people input a location
    and it would display the top ten ski areas near-ish you with flight ideas and weather for that place.

    1.
    SELECT a.last_name
    FROM actors a
    WHERE gender = "F"
    AND last_name LIKE 'Y%';

    2.
    SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    FROM actors a
    JOIN roles r ON r.actor_id = a.id
    JOIN movies_genres mg ON mg.movie_id = r.movie_id
    WHERE mg.genre = "Comedy"
    AND a.gender = "F";

    3.
    // Gives first names of actresses who play themselves
    SELECT a.first_name
    FROM actors a
    JOIN roles r ON r.actor_id = a.id
    JOIN movies m ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
    WHERE r.role = "Herself";

    // Gives list of movies (with repeats)
    SELECT m.name
        FROM actors a
        JOIN roles r ON r.actor_id = a.id
        JOIN movies m ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
        WHERE r.role = "Herself";
